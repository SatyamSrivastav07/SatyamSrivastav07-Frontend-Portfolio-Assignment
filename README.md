# My Portfolio Website

This is my assignment for frontend development class. I created a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I Built

A responsive portfolio website that shows my projects and skills. The website has different sections like home, projects, testimonials, and contact form.

## Technologies I Used

- HTML5 - for the website structure
- CSS3 - for styling and making it look good
- JavaScript - for interactive features like carousel and forms
- Google Fonts

## Features

- Responsive design that works on phones, tablets, and computers
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Image carousel for testimonials
- Contact form with basic validation
- Modal popup for hire button
- Sticky navigation bar

## How to Run

1. Open `index-assignment.html` in any web browser
2. That's it! The website should work

## File Structure

```
├── index-assignment.html    # Main HTML file
├── assignment-style.css     # All the CSS styles
├── assignment-script.js     # JavaScript for interactions
├── images/                  # All images used
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Sections of the Website

1. **Home** - Introduction with my name and hire button
2. **Projects** - Shows 6 projects in a grid layout
3. **Testimonials** - Carousel with customer reviews
4. **Contact** - Form to contact me and my information
5. **Footer** - Links and social media icons

## Responsive Design

The website changes layout based on screen size:
- Desktop: Full layout with all features
- Tablet: Adjusted spacing and some layout changes  
- Mobile: Stacked layout and hidden navigation
